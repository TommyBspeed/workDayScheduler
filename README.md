# workDayScheduler

My Task
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## My Process

The starter code included a complete css file, a nearly complete HTML file and was already linked to jQuery and Bootstrap. My job is to build the functional table and save buttons with a color-coded system to show the past, present and future time cards. In addition to dynamically updating the HTML, I need to ensure that user input can be saved to the local storage with the save buttons.
